# Tests

  These test are an old proof of concept to assess whether the libpd library 
would actually work.  You can use the old cordova-pd.js if you do not plan on
using Angular JS in your projects.  
  The new cordova-pd.js in /www folder is a more codified object oriented version
of the plugin.  These tests will probably disappear soon.
